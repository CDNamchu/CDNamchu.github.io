# About Me

Hi, I'm Cyprian Dyenree Namchu, a software developer and researcher passionate about blockchain security, machine learning, and building robust data systems.

## What I Do

I work at the intersection of security, AI, and software engineering. My current focus areas include:

### Blockchain Security
I specialize in smart contract vulnerability detection using graph neural networks (GNNs). My work involves analyzing Solidity code patterns, identifying security vulnerabilities, and developing automated detection systems to help secure decentralized applications.

### Machine Learning & AI
I apply deep learning and graph neural networks to code analysis problems. I work with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and various ML frameworks to build practical AI solutions that solve real-world problems.

### Data Engineering
I build data pipelines, ETL processes, and business intelligence solutions using modern tools like PostgreSQL, dbt, and various visualization platforms. I enjoy the challenge of turning messy data into actionable insights.

### Software Development
From backend APIs to frontend interfaces, I create end-to-end solutions using Python, JavaScript, Solidity, and SQL. I participate in hackathons and contribute to open-source projects when I can.

## Background

I'm bridging academic research with practical implementation through my work in blockchain security and artificial intelligence. This blog is where I share what I'm learning, document my projects, and hopefully help others understand complex technical concepts through hands-on examples.

## Technologies I Use

- **Languages:** Python, Solidity, JavaScript, SQL
- **ML/AI:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Graph Neural Networks
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum, Algorand, Slither, Smart Contract Analysis
- **Data:** PostgreSQL, dbt, ETL Pipelines
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, Streamlit, Discord.py
