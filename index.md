# Hi, I'm Cyprian 👋

I'm a software developer and researcher exploring the intersection of blockchain security, machine learning, and data engineering. I write about smart contract vulnerability detection, graph neural networks, and building practical solutions to complex problems.

## What I Write About

I share insights from my work in:
- **Smart Contract Security** - Vulnerability detection, Solidity analysis, and blockchain security research
- **Machine Learning** - Graph neural networks, deep learning, and AI applications in code analysis
- **Data Engineering** - Building ETL pipelines, data processing, and business intelligence
- **Software Development** - Full-stack development, hackathon projects, and technical experiments
