## 📖 About

This is my personal blog where I write about blockchain security research, graph neural networks, and full-stack development. I share insights from my work on smart contract vulnerability detection, machine learning experiments, and data engineering projects.

I bridge academic research with practical implementation, documenting what I learn from hackathons, research work, and real-world development challenges.

## 🎯 What I Write About

### Smart Contract Security
Vulnerability detection techniques, Solidity best practices, and GNN-based analysis methods for blockchain security.

### Machine Learning & AI
Graph neural networks, deep learning pipelines, and ML model development with focus on code analysis applications.

### Data Engineering
ETL processes, database design patterns, BI pipelines using PostgreSQL, dbt, and visualization tools.

### Hackathon Projects
Technical solutions, project breakdowns, and collaboration insights from cybersecurity and Web3 hackathons.

### Software Development
Full-stack development, technical experiments, and lessons learned from building real applications.
